# Music_Generation_Wavenet

I have referred https://github.com/karthiknagarajansundar/automatic-music-generation/tree/main/src extensively.
I have changed the code a bit as the default code will not execute properly.

One has create a 'metal_midi' folder in the src folder and copy the .mid files from the Data folder into it
One also needs to create folder 'output' in the src folder

I have added the code for playing the song as well so that one can have a single code to run the music once generated.
